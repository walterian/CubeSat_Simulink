Description:
  Model   AD9625_2500.pmf
  DLL     MOTIF.dll or libMOTIF.so
  Arch    64-bit
  Version 1.0.0.18

  This code simulates operation of the AD9625.  The simulation generates a tone, passes it 
  through a model of the device, and takes an FFT of the results.  It also allows the user
  to configure some digital features of the device.  Feel free to modify the code to suit
  your application.

Install:
  Unzip the contents into some working folder.
  
Usage:
  From MATLAB:
    Run Main.m by typing "Main" (it may prompt you to change directories).  To change the behavior of
    the model modify AD9625_Configure.m, save, and rerun Main.

  From Simulink:
    Open the AD9625.slx model and run.  Edit the AD9625 mask to change operating conditions of the model.

    This requires the DSP Toolbox.

Troubleshoot:
  If MATLAB complains that a compiler has not been selected, type "mex -setup" and follow the instrustions.
  Rerun Main.m
  
  If MATLAB complains that there is a problem with loadlibrary, it might be an issue with having
  a valid supported C compiler.  In Windows, MATLAB doesn't work with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
  Redistributables.  You will need to uninstall any references to VS 2010 Redistributable and 
  install the Windows SDK 7.1.
